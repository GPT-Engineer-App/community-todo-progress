# community-todo-progress

Hello, I already have a landing page for my website however I would like create a todo - list and a progress bar to all of this so that my community can post what they want to see more of, comment and like on this and so that we as developer also can show the progress of each feature. 

We already have a web app for the project where we have the original functions where one has to sign in to be able to use it. I would like such that for people to be able to comment and like each oterhs opinions in this todo list they also have to log into their accounts. 

However, they can see all of the comments and stuff without being logged in. 

Can you help me structure this website where I am using firebase as the data storage. where everybody also are logged into
